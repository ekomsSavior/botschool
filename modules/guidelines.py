📜 Ethical Use Guidelines – BotSchool

BotSchool is an open-source educational tool designed to teach ethical red teamers how botnets work from a defender’s mindset.

This tool must be used for:

✅ Learning how attackers build, launch, and manage botnets
✅ Practicing detection, response, and mitigation techniques
✅ Building better defenses in your own labs or virtual environments

❌ Never use this tool on real systems you do not own or control.
❌ Never deploy simulated botnets outside of a safe test environment.
❌ Never use this knowledge to harm others, break laws, or attack networks.

🤍 Remember: with great power comes great accountability.
You are the future of ethical hacking — make it beautiful.
